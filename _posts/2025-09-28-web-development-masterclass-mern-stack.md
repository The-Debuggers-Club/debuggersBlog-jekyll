A comprehensive session on full-stack web development using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Build modern, scalable web applications from scratch.

## MERN Stack Overview

The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript-based technology stack for building dynamic web applications. It consists of:

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development

## What You'll Build

During this masterclass, you'll create a complete full-stack application:

- **Frontend**: Modern React application with hooks and context
- **Backend**: RESTful API using Express.js and Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication
- **Deployment**: Deploy your application to the cloud
